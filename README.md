Machuhu - a GLSL viewer.

How to use:
    Run machuchu.py
    Click a "Load" button and choose a shader file (.f).
    Use W,A,S,D keys to pan a view, period and comma keys to zoom. Press Esc to quit, 
    P to pause and R to reload the file. If the shader's code is changed
    during run, it will be reloaded automatically.

We called it machuchu, because we love Miyamoto-sensei.
